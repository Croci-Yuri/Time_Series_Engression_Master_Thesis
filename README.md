**Supervisors:** Prof. Dr. Sebastian Engelke <br> 

## Purpose

This repository contains the complete implementation and results from my thesis. It provides full transparency on the models and pipeline, including the exploratory data analysis and grid search analysis that were only partially covered in the paper due to space constraints. The code to reproduce all plots and results is also included.
